    <p1 class="common">Hello World! Make a small <em>website</em> about a
    passion or interest of yours. We’ll be using
    this project as a way to introduce ourselves,
    as well as a space to practice and experiment
    writing html and css. An <small>important</small> goal of
    this project is to allow yourself to <strong>experiment</strong>
    and remain flexible with the presentation of
    the site. Most likely, this is the first site
    you will be writing by hand — try to let it
    grow and learn with you! Start by collecting
    content about the passion you've chosen from
    wherever that content is found: internet,
    books, outside (maybe it is content you have
    authored yourself) and then start to write
    your code. <a href="file:///Users/catygrace/passion/html/projects/newindex2.html">Link</a></p1>
